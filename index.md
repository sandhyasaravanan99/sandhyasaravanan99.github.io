## About Me

I am currently a Research Fellow in the EzPC group, the cryptography wing of Microsoft Research India, advised by [Divya Gupta](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/digup/) and [Nishanth Chandran](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/nichandr/). We work on the applications of secure multi party computation to privacy preserving machine learning and database operations. 

Prior to joining MSR, I spent two years at Microsoft, Bengaluru as a Software Developer, working with O365 Connectors and Actionable Messages, a feature that embeds actions like approvals and notifications like news digests within an Outlook email or Teams channel. I was also a Software Developer Intern at Microsoft, Hyderabad in 2020 in the Professional Services and Data Insights team. I graduated in 2021 with a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering.

I was a part of Delta Force, the programming club of NIT Trichy that takes care of all institute and festival development activities. We conducted Pragyan Capture the Flag, where I was responsible for problem setting and platform setup in the Cryptography field.

## Research Interests

- Secure Computation
- Zero Knowledge
- Cryptographic Applications
- (To be updated :) )

Broadly, I'm interested in both theoretical and applied cryptography.
